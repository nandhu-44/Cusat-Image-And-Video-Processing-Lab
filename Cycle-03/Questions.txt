# Set-3
1. Write a program which restores a degraded image using direct inverse filtering.
2. Write a program for implementing Wiener filtering for linear image restoration using (a) a constant ratio and (b) auto correlation function.
3. Write a program to convert an RGB color space to HSI. Display the Hue image, Saturation image and the Intensity image.
4. Write a program to histogram equalize the Intensity component of a color image and get a new HSI image. Convert the new HSI image back to RGB.
5. Write a program to detect the line segments in a binary image using Hough Transform.
6. Consider an image composed of small, non overlapping blobs. Write a program to segment the blobs based on thresholding.
7. Consider an image composed of small, non overlapping blobs. Write a program to segment the blobs based on region growing.
8. Write a program to implement the split and merge procedure for segmenting the image with different values for minimum dimensions of the quad-tree regions.
9. Consider a binary image composed of small blobs. Write a program to segment the blobs using watershed transform.
