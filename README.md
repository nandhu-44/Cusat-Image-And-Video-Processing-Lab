# Digital Image And Video Processing Lab - CUSAT

This repository contains solutions for the Digital Image Processing lab assignments at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT).

## Overview

Basic implementations of fundamental image processing operations using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. Each question demonstrates core concepts with practical examples.

## Lab Questions

### Question 1: Basic Image Operations

- Read and display images
- Extract image information (dimensions, channels, data type)
- Calculate compression ratios
- Create negative images

### Question 2: Histogram Analysis

- Plot histograms for grayscale and color images
- Visualize pixel intensity distributions
- Compare different color channels

### Question 3: Histogram Equalization

- Global histogram equalization
- Color image equalization (BGR and YUV methods)
- Manual implementation of histogram equalization
- Before/after comparisons

### Question 4: Local Histogram Equalization

- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Comparison with global methods
- Different tile sizes and parameters

### Question 5: Image Enhancement Operations

- Brightness and contrast enhancement
- Image complement (negative)
- Binary contrast enhancement
- Brightness slicing
- Low-pass and high-pass filtering
